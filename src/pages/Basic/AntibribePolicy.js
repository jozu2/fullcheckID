                Our commitment to ethical business practices involves an
                unequivocal opposition to all forms of bribery and corruption.
                We strive to conduct our business dealings with the utmost
                honesty, professionalism, and integrity. This commitment extends
                to prohibiting inappropriate promises, gifts, or excessive
                hospitality to Foreign Public Officials for obtaining any unjust
                advantage or benefit. We also resist any attempts by external
                parties, including suppliers and clients, to improperly
                influence any decision-making processes for undue gains. Our
                staff, representing the ethos of Blockchain Management
                Corporation Pty Ltd, are obliged to uphold these principles at
                all times.
                <br />
                Political contributions are not endorsed, and facilitation
                payments are discouraged as a business method. However, we
                support making charitable donations and sponsorships, provided
                they align with ethical standards and comply with local legal
                frameworks. We also expect our business partners and
                Representatives to implement robust systems to counteract
                bribery. In compliance with Australian legal requirements, we
                commit to documenting and reporting any instances of legal
                breaches or policy violations.

                thorough and proportionate AB&C due diligence on any CSR
                programs prior to engagement. This includes a comprehensive
                assessment of the beneficiary, including research of independent
                sources and a series of meetings and interviews. Essential
                considerations include the context of the program, legal status
                of the beneficiary, historical background, board member
                scrutiny, and budget transparency.
                <br />
                Ongoing measures include monitoring the beneficiary's use of
                funds, requiring multiple management approvals for payments,
                setting cash limits, and demanding periodic written reports from
                the recipient.

                suspicions or concerns related to bribery and corruption without

                reporting procedures, their right to anonymity, and the support
                mechanisms in place for whistleblowers. All reported allegations
                are to be promptly addressed through the appropriate channels,

                reporting and stress that personal investigations or contact
